K-Bus Line Input to TH3122
The BMW K-Bus wire passes through an RC filter and then connects to pin 6 (BUS) on TH3122.
The RC filter minimizes EMI on the BUS line, and is recommended per TH3122 datasheet.
The RC filter is a 10 ohm resistor and a 100pF non-polarized capacitor.

Voltage Supply to TH3122
+12V supply voltage passes through a diode (D1), and connects to pins 1 (VS) and 2 (EN).
Pin 1 (VS) powers the TH3122. Pin 2 (EN) enables the +5 Voltage regulator feature, on pin 16 (VCC).
The circuit also has a 47uF capacitor on the +12V line to reduce short time voltage drops.

Regulated Voltage from TH3122
VCC provides the arduino with +5V; It is also connected to a 1uF capacitor (C5) to reduce short time voltage drops. 
Capacitor C5 is suggested to be above 2uF in the TH3122 datasheet. I stuck with 1uF for flexibility (smaller variety of parts), and due to the MAX232 datasheet specifying 1uF - for the RS232 project.

K-Bus Data Output from TH3122
Pin 11 (TX) is connected to the Arduino's transmit pin.
Pin 10 (RX) is connected to the Arduino's receive pin.
Pin 9 (SEN/STA) is connected to the Arduino's digital input pin 2.
The SEN/STA signal stays High while there is data/activity on the K-Bus, and goes Low when there is no
activity. This is used in the Arduino programming to tell when it's safe to send data onto the K-Bus.

Misc
Pin 3 (VTR) is connected to VCC; It sets reset timing (See TH3122 Datasheet).
Pins 7 (SO) and 8 (SI) on the TH3122 can be used as a universal comparator.
We do not need this feature, so we ground pin 8 (SI), the comparator input.
Pins 14 (RESET) and 15 (SENSE) are not used for this project.
Pins 4, 5, 12, and 13 are all Grounds.
