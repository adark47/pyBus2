I don't have a schematic? online, but the iBus transceiver circuit is very simple. Check the data sheet for the MCP2004 chip which is what I use for the transceiver. Basically, the circuit is: pin 1 to arduino RX and through R1 to +5v, pin 2 through R2 to +5v, pin 3 to arduino digital pin (set high to enable transmit), pin 4 to arduino TX, pin 5 to gnd, pin 6 to iBus, pin 7 to iBus power (+12v), pin 8 not connected
